## History

Mario stands for M.A.R. Input Output Data transfer of our accounting data to different OS or Frameworks.

- It is a project started in 1987 for porting accounting data from systems created by Mallard BASIC B-Plus tree from CP/M to MS-DOS.
- Few years later when Windows 3.1 and Visual Basic 2.0 came around the corner in 1992, it did the transfer between Mallard Basic B-Plus tree data to NOVELL database.
- In 1995, I ported it to Windows 95 and Visual Basic 4.0 who also serves an indexing database called Jet Engine (Microsoft Access).
- These days, MarioApp is a .NET 8 application that can be used to export the Jet Engine database to a sqlserver database.
- Added functionality from 2025, support for Peppol exchange sending and receiving invoices, credit notes and orders.
